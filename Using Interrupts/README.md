# Using Interrupts
A simple example of using interrupts with Arduino to get around some issues caused by delay. There are often better ways to work around delay, but some libraries require it and you have no choice.

For more info please see the [Arduino Documentation](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/language/functions/external-interrupts/attachinterrupt/).
